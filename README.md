# Berry Hunter: The Fox's Journey
This is our final project for our "Game development with the Unity cross-platform game engine" class.

## Description of the game
Berry Hunter is a platformer game that was created using Unity. It's one continuous level seperated into 6 areas, each with their own defining landscape and features. To feel a sense of accomplishment, there's both a jump counter 
and a stopwatch on the top of the screen.There are no savepoints and was absolutely made with the intention of enraging the player. This game is aimed for those that are patient, stubborn, and willing to risk their sanity in order 
to achieve greatness.

## Story
World renowned food critic, The Fox, is constantly on the hunt for new and savoury foods. After nearly a decade of following whispers of a supposedly delicious berry, he finally tracks it down. Unfortunately for him, the berry is
not only located on the top of one of the tallest and most dangerous mountains known to animals, but is also heavily guarded by The Bird and her children. Unable to resist a good meal or challenge, The Fox starts his perilous
journey where he knows his prize is waiting for him.

## Controls
The game only allows you to move left or right and jump. To move sideways, you can use either the left and right arrows keys or the 'a' and 'd' keys. To jump, you can use either the spacebar or the up arrow. You can also press
the "esc" button to open the settings menu, which is mostly a sound menu.

## How to run
This project was made using Unity in the 2022.2.2f1 version. Assuming you have the software in the appropriate version, simply clone the repository and run it there. If you want the full experience, you can also export it from
the Unity editor into an executable.

To turn the game into a .exe file:
- Go to File
- Go to Build Settings
- Select your platform (win/mac/linux/xbox/etc etc)
- Click on build
